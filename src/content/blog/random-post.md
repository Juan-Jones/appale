Web development is a popular field in the tech industry. It involves building web software using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ sometimes with the help of various frameworks and libraries.



Using libraries and frameworks allows developers to focus more on the development while the tools take care of certain functionality in the background. And React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building front-end applications.



In this article, youâ€™ll learn about the backbone of React which is Hooks, and how they can make your life easier as a developer.

Some Random Hooks



Conclusion



Prerequisites:

You should know the basics of JavaScript.



You should also know the basics of React, like setting up an app, updating it, and using state.



Getting Started

So you've decided to build a React appâ€”congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ But as you dive into the world of React hooks, you might find yourself feeling overwhelmed. With a plethora of hooks available, figuring out which ones to use and when can be a bit daunting.



Well, donâ€™t worry â€“ in this guide, Iâ€™ll break down every major hook so you can see how they fit together. Weâ€™ll also discuss which ones you'll use more frequently versus more rarely.



By the end of this article, you'll have a comprehensive map of React hooks and their practical applications.



What are Hooks?

In JavaScript, we use variables to store data and later perform operations on that data.



Hooks in React work similarly, but they are designed to manage state in functional components. Instead of manually declaring a single variable, hooks like useState give us a way to declare stateful values along with a setter function to update that state.



Hereâ€™s a simple example:



import React, { useState } from 'react';



`function Counter() {`

`  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // Initialize state and state updater`

``

`  return (`

`    <div>`

`      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>`

`      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>`

`    </div>`

`  );`

`}`

In this code, I use the useState hook to declare a piece of state called count and set its initial value to 0. The setCount function allows us to update this state. Every time the button is clicked, we use setCount to increase count by 1. When the state updates, React re-renders the component to reflect the change.



Unlike declaring let count = 0, using useState lets React remember the state across renders and ensures that the UI updates correctly.
